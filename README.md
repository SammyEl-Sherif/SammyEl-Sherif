I am currently finishing my final semester of my CS degree at the University of Colorado - Denver. Next, I will be heading to Grainger's technology group for a software engineering position where I will take on their 2 year rotational program. Last summer I interned at Grainger on their Cloud Foundations team, which sparked a large interest in cloud infrastructure for me. But, I am still very excited to go through their rotational program and grow my breadth of software engineering knowledge.
